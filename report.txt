Process you used to complete the assignment (including organization,
understanding the starter code, and building a solution):

In order to complete this assignment, we studied the lecture slides, tutorial
slides and/or researched online materials.

Our first task of rendering a generic image led us learn about geometric 
intersections, which included understanding the ray trace algorithm, which we
implemented after that.

We had to draw multiple diagrams to properly understand projections and 
coordinate frames in order to correct our rendering.

Lastly, we did all of these simultaneously with implementing the functions.

Brief description code implemented (including "cruncy" part of the code):

We implemented this assignment in increments. 
First, we tackled the rendering of a general plane object only, whereby 
we ensured we understood all the functions we were required to write 
and ensuring we understand all the transformations to render an object.
Second, once we hand the plane rendering, we worked on rendering the spheres,

Our next step was to render the shadowing, as per the pseudocode, followed by
the recursing in rayTrace function to allow reflections, with the use of 
phong illuminations. This culminated our basic rendering of an image.

Later, we developed our image further by adding anti-aliasing, area lights, 
cylinderical object(s), texture mapping, multithreading, and environment map,
leading to a "neat" scene.

Easy and hard parts of the assigment:

We found this assignment generally very challenging as it had to be 
implemented in c, which requires direct memory management and resolving many
segmentation faults. Nevertheless, theory-wise, we had trouble understanding
which parts of the code we were to fill up and the coordinate system required
for rendering. Moreover, implementing the ray trace recursion was also 
challenging, however, the difficulty was alleviated by the tutorial slides.
For the more advanced ray tracing, we found area lights and environment mapping
harder to implement.
